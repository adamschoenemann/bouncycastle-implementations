BouncyCastle Implementations
============================

Some cryptographic algorithms that I implemented with Jason Murphy in University of California: Santa Barbara (UCSB) with the supervision of Prof. Dr. Cetin Kaya Koc using Bouncy Castle API.

Algorithms include: AES (Advance Encryption Standard), ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman), ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), RSA and hash algorithms.
